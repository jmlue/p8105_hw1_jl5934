# Problem 1

## Describing the Dataset

The variables of the dataset are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour.

The size of the dataset is 358 rows by 15 columns.

The samples are all originating from ‘EWR’. during the month of January
2013. The days range from 1-15, and hours from 0-23 to represent a 24
hour day.

The mean temperature of the 385 observations in the dataset is
39.5821229 degrees Celsius, with a standard deviation of 7.058637
degrees Celsius.

In addition, the mean dew point of the dataset is 28.057095, mean
humidity of the dataset is 65.4767039, mean wind speed is 8.2258269,
mean precipitation is 0.0020391, and mean visbility was 8.5153352.

``` r
scatter_df <- tibble(
  x = pull(early_january_weather, time_hour),
  y = pull(early_january_weather, temp)
) 

ggplot(scatter_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = early_january_weather$humid)) + geom_point()
```

# Problem 2

## Constructing the dataframe

``` r
df_2 = tibble(
  norm_sample = rnorm(10, mean = 1),
  norm_sample_pos = norm_sample > 0,
  char = "helloworld",
  factor = factor(c("first", "second", "third", "first", "second", "third", "first", "second", "third", "first"), levels = c("first", "second", "third"))
)
```

## Means of the dataframe

The mean of the random sample of normal distribution is 0.7553357.

The mean of the logical vector is 0.7.

The mean of the character vector is NA when attempted via “r
mean(pull(df_2, char))”

The mean of the factor vector is NA when attempted via “r
mean(pull(df_2, factor))”

## Chaging data type

``` r
df_2$char = as.numeric(as.character(df_2$char))

df_2$factor =  as.numeric(as.factor(df_2$factor))
```

When we try to convert the character vector into a numeric one, it is
unable to and coerces them all to NA. However when we attempt it with
the factor level it is able to convert it to numeric, assigning values
from 1-3 based on the factor level it was originally.
