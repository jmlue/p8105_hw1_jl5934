# Problem 1

The variables of the dataset are `r names(early_january_weather)`.

The size of the dataset is `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows by `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.

The mean temperature of the 385 observations in the dataset is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)` degrees Celsius. 
```{r scatterplot}
scatter_df <- tibble(
  x = early_january_weather$time_hour,
  y = early_january_weather$temp
) 

ggplot(scatter_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = early_january_weather$humid)) + geom_point()
```

```{r output plot}
ggsave("scatterplot_problem1.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
